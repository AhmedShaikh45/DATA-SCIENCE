    "For example:\n",
    "- running → run  \n",
    "- better → good  \n",
    "- studies → study  \n",

    "## 🔹 What is Named Entity Recognition?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is an NLP technique used to **identify and classify important entities** in text into predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:  \n",
    "> NER finds **names of people, places, organizations, dates, etc.** inside a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Example of NER\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence:\n",
    "> \"Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 in the United States.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### NER Output:\n",
    "- **Elon Musk** → Person  \n",
    "- **SpaceX** → Organization  \n",
    "- **2002** → Date  \n",
    "- **United States** → Location  \n",
    "\n",
    "NER converts **raw text → structured information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why NER is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "NER helps computers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand **real-world meaning** of text  \n",
    "- Extract **useful information automatically**  \n",
    "- Convert **unstructured text into structured data**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search engines  \n",
    "- Chatbots  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Rule-Based NER\n",
    "- Uses **hand-written rules + dictionaries**\n",
    "- Example: capitalized words → possible names  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- Uses models like **CRF, HMM**\n",
    "- Learns patterns from labeled data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Better accuracy  \n",
    "**Cons:** Needs feature engineering  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🧠 spaCy Library — Introduction & Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**spaCy** is a fast and industrial-strength **Natural Language Processing (NLP) library** used to build **real-world NLP applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:  \n",
    "> spaCy helps developers process, analyze, and understand large amounts of text efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike research-focused libraries, spaCy is designed for **production use** with speed, accuracy, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why spaCy Is Used\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is popular because it:\n",

    "## 🔹 spaCy NLP Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy processes text using a **pipeline of components**, where each component adds linguistic information to the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical pipeline:\n",
    "1. Tokenizer  \n",
    "2. Tagger (POS tagging)  \n",
    "3. Parser (Dependency parsing)  \n",
    "4. Named Entity Recognizer (NER)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each step enriches the text object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Core Components Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Tokenization\n",
    "Splits text into words, punctuation, and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\"I love NLP!\" → [\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\", \"!\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging\n",
    "Assigns grammatical roles to tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- \"love\" → verb  \n",
    "- \"NLP\" → noun  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Lemmatization\n",
    "Converts words into their base form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- running → run  \n",
    "- better → good  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "Identifies real-world entities in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Person → Ahmed  \n",
    "- Organization → Google  \n",
    "- Location → India  \n",
    "- Date → 2025  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Dependency Parsing\n",
    "Shows grammatical relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- Subject–verb relationships  \n",
    "- Object dependencies  \n",
    "\n",
    "Helps understand sentence structure.\n",

    "## 🔹 What is Bag of Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of Words (BoW)** is a simple and widely used **text feature extraction technique** in NLP that converts text into **numerical form** based on **word frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:  \n",
    "> BoW represents a sentence by **counting how many times each word appears**, ignoring grammar and word order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why the Name “Bag of Words”?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bag** → words are treated like items in a bag  \n",
    "- **Order is ignored**  \n",
    "- Only **which words appear and how often** matters  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1:  \n",
    "> \"I love NLP\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2:  \n",
    "> \"NLP love I\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both have the **same BoW representation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 How Bag of Words Works (Step-by-Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect all sentences** (corpus)\n",
    "2. **Create vocabulary** of unique words\n",
    "3. **Count frequency** of each word in every sentence\n",
    "4. **Convert text → numeric vector**\n",

    "## 🔹 Why Bag of Words is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "BoW is important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machines **cannot understand text directly**\n",
    "- ML models require **numerical input**\n",
    "- BoW provides a **simple baseline representation**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Advantages of Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very **simple and easy to implement**\n",
    "- Works well for **basic NLP tasks**\n",
    "- Fast to compute\n",
    "- No complex training required\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🔹 Limitations of Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignores word order**  \n",
    "  (\"dog bites man\" = \"man bites dog\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignores context and meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produces **sparse and high-dimensional vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cannot capture **semantic relationships**\n",

    "## 🧠 Word2Vec — Explanation + Interview Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is Word2Vec?\n",
    "Word2Vec is a **word embedding technique** in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that converts words into **dense numerical vectors**. These vectors capture **semantic and syntactic relationships** between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Words with similar meanings have vectors that are close to each other in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Core Idea (Intuition)\n",
    "> Words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "king − man + woman ≈ queen\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Why Word2Vec is Needed\n",
    "Traditional methods like Bag of Words and TF-IDF:\n",
    "- Create sparse vectors  \n",
    "- Ignore word meaning and context  \n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec solves this by:\n",
    "- Creating dense, low-dimensional vectors  \n",
    "- Capturing semantic similarity  \n",
    "- Preserving relationships between words  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Word2Vec Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)\n",
    "- Predicts the **target word** using surrounding context words  \n",
    "- Faster training  \n",
    "- Works well for frequent words  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"I love ___ learning\" → machine\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Skip-Gram\n",
    "- Predicts **context words** using the target word  \n",
    "- Better for rare words  \n",
    "- More accurate but slower  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "machine → {I, love, learning}\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Training Objective (Simple)\n",
    "Word2Vec learns word vectors by maximizing the probability of correct word–context pairs and minimizing incorrect ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Optimization Techniques\n",
    "- Negative Sampling  \n",
    "- Hierarchical Softmax  \n",
    "\n",
    "These reduce training time for large vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Aim of Word2Vec\n",
    "- Learn meaningful word representations  \n",
    "- Capture semantic relationships  \n",
    "- Reduce dimensionality  \n",
    "- Improve NLP model performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Why We Use Word2Vec\n",
    "- Understand word similarity  \n",
    "- Improve text classification, search, NLP tasks  \n",
    "- Better than BoW and TF-IDF for meaning  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Limitations\n",
    "- Cannot handle unseen (OOV) words  \n",
    "- Same word has same vector in all contexts  \n",
    "- Requires large datasets  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** is a numerical text-representation technique used in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to measure  \n",
    "**how important a word is in a document compared to the entire collection of documents (corpus).**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> TF-IDF highlights **important, meaningful words** in a document  \n",
    "> and reduces the weight of **very common words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an **improvement over Bag of Words**, because it considers  \n",
    "**word importance**, not just **word frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why TF-IDF is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem with **Bag of Words**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common words like **“the”, “is”, “and”** appear very frequently  \n",
    "- These words get **high counts** but carry **little meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF solves this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lowering weight of common words**\n",
    "- **Increasing weight of rare, meaningful words**\n",
    "- Producing **better features for machine learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Core Idea Behind TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is based on two intuitive questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Does the word appear many times in this document?**  \n",
    "   → If yes, it is probably **important** in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Does the word appear in many other documents too?**  \n",
    "   → If yes, it is probably **not unique** and should get **lower importance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these two ideas gives **TF × IDF**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Term Frequency (TF) — Importance Inside One Document\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Frequency** measures **how often a word appears in a single document**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More occurrences → more relevance **within that document**\n",
    "- But very repeated words should **not dominate completely**\n",
    "\n",
    "So TF usually uses **normalized or scaled frequency**  \n",
    "instead of just raw counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) — Rarity Across All Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse Document Frequency** measures **how rare a word is in the whole corpus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word appears in **many documents** → **low importance**\n",
    "- Word appears in **few documents** → **high importance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus IDF acts like a **penalty for common words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Final TF-IDF Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "The final importance of a word is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF = (importance in this document) × (rarity across all documents)**\n",
    "\n",
    "So a word gets **high TF-IDF** only when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It appears **frequently in one document**\n",
    "- But **rarely in other documents**\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes TF-IDF very useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword extraction**\n",
    "- **Document ranking**\n",
    "- **Text classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Step-by-Step Working of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect all documents (**corpus**)\n",
    "2. Build **vocabulary of unique words**\n",
    "3. Compute **TF for each word in each document**\n",
    "4. Compute **IDF using all documents**\n",
    "5. Multiply **TF × IDF**\n",
    "6. Represent each document as a **numeric vector**\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts **text → mathematical representation**  \n",
    "usable by **machine learning models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Example Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “I love NLP”  \n",
    "- “I love machine learning”\n",
    "\n",
    "Words like **“I”** and **“love”**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Appear in **both documents**\n",
    "- Therefore receive **low TF-IDF weight**\n",
    "\n",
    "Words like **“NLP”, “machine”, “learning”**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Appear in **fewer documents**\n",
    "- Therefore receive **higher TF-IDF weight**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence TF-IDF highlights **truly informative words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why TF-IDF Works Well\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is powerful because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filters **noise words**\n",
    "- Emphasizes **keywords**\n",
    "- Produces **meaningful numeric features**\n",
    "- Works well with **traditional ML algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why TF-IDF became a **standard baseline** in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Applications of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is widely used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search engines** (ranking relevant documents)\n",
    "- **Spam detection**\n",
    "- **Document similarity**\n",
    "- **Topic classification**\n",
    "- **Sentiment analysis**\n",
    "- **Information retrieval systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Advantages of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple yet **very effective**\n",
    "- Better than **Bag of Words**\n",
    "- Highlights **important keywords**\n",
    "- Computationally efficient\n",
    "- Works well on **small and medium datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Limitations of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its usefulness, TF-IDF has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignores word order**\n",
    "- Cannot capture **context or meaning**\n",
    "- Produces **sparse high-dimensional vectors**\n",
    "- Cannot understand **semantics**\n",
    "- Outperformed by **Word Embeddings and Transformers**\n",
    "\n",
    "So TF-IDF is considered a **classical NLP technique**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🤖 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) — Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is a **pre-trained deep learning language model** developed by Google for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks. Unlike traditional models that read text in one direction, BERT reads text **bidirectionally**, meaning it understands a word based on **both its left and right context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bidirectional understanding allows BERT to capture **deep semantic meaning and context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why BERT Was Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier NLP models (BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec):\n",
    "- Could not fully understand context  \n",
    "- Were often unidirectional  \n",
    "- Treated the same word the same in all sentences  \n",
    "\n",
    "BERT solves this by:\n",
    "- Understanding context from both directions  \n",
    "- Producing **context-aware word representations**  \n",
    "- Improving performance across many NLP tasks  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Core Idea of BERT (Simple Intuition)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The meaning of a word depends on the words around it — on both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- \"bank\" in *river bank* vs *bank account*\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT assigns **different embeddings** to the same word depending on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 What Does “Bidirectional” Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional models:\n",
    "- Read text left → right or right → left  \n",
    "\n",
    "BERT:\n",
    "- Reads the entire sentence **at once**\n",
    "- Uses both previous and next words to understand meaning  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **deep bidirectional context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 BERT Architecture (High Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is based on the **Transformer Encoder** architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components:\n",
    "- Multi-Head Self-Attention  \n",
    "- Positional Embeddings  \n",
    "- Feed-Forward Neural Networks  \n",
    "- Layer Normalization  \n",
    "\n",
    "BERT uses **only encoders**, not decoders.\n",

    "## 🔹 Pretraining Tasks in BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is trained using two self-supervised tasks:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Masked Language Modeling (MLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomly masks some words in a sentence  \n",
    "- Model predicts the masked words using context  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"I love [MASK] learning\" → machine\n",
    "\n",
    "This forces BERT to learn bidirectional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model learns whether one sentence logically follows another  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Fine-Tuning BERT\n",
