    "In simple words:  \n",
    "> Activation functions decide whether a neuron should be active and how strong its output should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are essential because they add **non-linearity**, which allows neural networks to learn **complex patterns**.\n",

    "## 🔹 Why Activation Functions Are Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Without activation functions:\n",
    "- Neural networks become **linear**\n",
    "- Multiple layers behave like a single layer\n",
    "- Complex problems cannot be solved\n",

    "Activation functions make deep learning possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 How Activation Function Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron:\n",
    "1. Takes weighted inputs and bias  \n",
    "2. Computes a value  \n",
    "3. Applies an activation function  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Step (Threshold) Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The step activation function outputs a binary result based on a fixed threshold. If the input exceeds the threshold, the neuron activates; otherwise, it remains inactive. This function was used in early neural network models such as the **Perceptron** for simple binary classification. However, because the function is **not differentiable** and produces abrupt output changes, it cannot support gradient-based learning like backpropagation. Therefore, it is not used in modern deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Output = 1 if input ≥ 0  \n",
    "- Output = 0 otherwise  \n",

    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simple logic  \n",
    "- Used in early perceptrons  \n",

    "- Not suitable for deep learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid activation function maps input values into a smooth range between **0 and 1**, making it suitable for probability-based outputs. It was introduced to overcome the non-differentiability of the step function and enabled backpropagation. However, sigmoid compresses large input values into very small gradients, leading to the **vanishing gradient problem** in deep networks. For this reason, it is rarely used in hidden layers today but is still used in binary classification output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Range:** 0 to 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Output interpretable as probability  \n",
    "- Smooth curve  \n",

    "\n",
    "The tanh activation function is a scaled and shifted version of sigmoid that outputs values between **−1 and +1**. Its zero-centered nature improves optimization by balancing positive and negative activations. Although tanh provides stronger gradients than sigmoid near zero, it still suffers from vanishing gradients for large input values, limiting its effectiveness in very deep networks.\n",

    "## 4️⃣ ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU is the most widely used activation function in modern deep learning. It outputs **zero for negative inputs** and passes **positive inputs unchanged**. This avoids saturation in the positive region, allowing strong gradient flow and efficient training of deep networks. ReLU significantly reduced the vanishing gradient problem, making deep architectures practical. However, neurons can become permanently inactive if they consistently receive negative inputs, known as the **dead neuron problem**.\n",

    "## 5️⃣ Leaky ReLU\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaky ReLU was introduced to solve the dead neuron problem of ReLU by allowing a **small, non-zero gradient** for negative input values. Instead of completely blocking negative signals, it allows a small slope, ensuring neurons continue to learn even for negative inputs. While it improves gradient flow, it introduces an extra hyperparameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "Softmax is used in the **output layer** of multi-class classification models. It converts raw scores into a probability distribution where the sum of all outputs equals **1**. Softmax highlights the most likely class while suppressing others and works best with categorical cross-entropy loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)** is a technique used in **deep learning** to make neural networks **train faster, more stable, and more accurate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:\n",
    "> Batch Normalization keeps the data flowing through the network **well-balanced**, so learning becomes easier.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why Batch Normalization Is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "During training:\n",
    "- Values inside the network can become **too large or too small**\n",
    "- This makes learning **slow and unstable**\n",
    "- Training deep networks becomes difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization solves this by:\n",
    "- Keeping values in a **normal range**\n",
    "- Reducing training instability\n",
    "- Allowing higher learning rates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 What Batch Normalization Does\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization **normalizes the output of a layer** before passing it to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It:\n",
    "1. Takes a mini-batch of data  \n",

    "\n",
    "In simple words:  \n",
    "> An optimizer decides **how the model should learn** from its mistakes.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 1. Convolution Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is the core operation of a CNN. It involves sliding a small matrix called a **filter (kernel)** over the input image to extract features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at the whole image at once, CNN focuses on **local regions**. Each filter learns a specific pattern such as edges, corners, or textures. The same filter is applied across the entire image, which is called **parameter sharing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why convolution is important:**\n",
    "- Captures spatial patterns\n",
    "- Reduces number of parameters\n",
    "- Preserves spatial relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of convolution is called a **feature map**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. CNN Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolution Layer  \n",
    "Applies filters to extract features from the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Layer (ReLU)  \n",
    "Introduces non-linearity by removing negative values. Without this, CNN would behave like a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooling Layer  \n",
    "Reduces the size of feature maps while keeping important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flatten Layer  \n",
    "Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fully Connected Layer  \n",
    "Combines all learned features to make final predictions.\n",

    "- Adds translation invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 5. Padding and Stride\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding  \n",
    "Padding adds extra pixels (usually zeros) around the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Valid padding** → no padding, output size reduces\n",
    "- **Same padding** → keeps output size same\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding helps preserve edge information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stride  \n",
    "Stride defines how many pixels the filter moves at a time.\n",

    "- Larger stride → smaller output\n",
    "- Smaller stride → more detailed feature maps\n",

    "Error is propagated backward:\n",
    "- Gradients are calculated\n",
    "- Filters and weights are updated\n",
