## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository covers the following areas of Data Science:

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis  
Notebooks that introduce techniques for analyzing datasets, uncovering trends, patterns, missing values, and insights.

### 🔹 Data Visualization  
Visual tools and libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are used to illustrate data patterns and insights.

### 🔹 Machine Learning  
Core ML concepts including model training, evaluation, and practical examples.

### 🔹 Feature Scaling  
Explains importance of scaling methods such as Standardization, Min-Max Scaling & Normalization using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, & **scikit-learn**.

### 🔹 Computer Vision & Deep Learning  
Basic introduction to computer vision tasks and deep learning techniques.

### 🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Text processing techniques and fundamental NLP applications.

### 🔹 Core Libraries & Tools  
Includes notebooks on:
- NumPy – numerical computing
- Pandas – data manipulation
- Plotly – interactive visualizations
- Seaborn – statistical visualizations
